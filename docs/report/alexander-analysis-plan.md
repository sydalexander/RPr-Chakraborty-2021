# Planned revsions to reproduction of

Author: Sydney, Alexander

## Analysis

The final choropleth map has a mistaken parameter causing it to use only half of the available color ramp; I will fix the incorrect parameter so that the full color ramp is used, thus improving the legibility of the map.

The missing data table formatting currently does not match the formatting of the other tables in the reproduction study; I will modify it using the **Kable/KableExtra** functions to match the formatting of the other tables.

I will move the rationale for the updated report to the very end, which will improve the flow of the paper. Emily's discussion, currently beneath the rationale, will be incorporated into the original discussion of the reproduction study, which will complete the discussion study rather than having it stretch between several different headings.

Any concluding statements about the success and effectiveness of the reproduction study will be separated out into a separate Conclusions section, which will also improve the logical flow of the paper and make it easier to follow.

## Results

There will only be one discussion section, instead of a Discussion section and a separate section for Emily's discussion.

There will also be a separate conclusions section.

The **Rationale for the updated report** will be at the end of the report, after the new discussions section.

The final choropleth map will use the full color ramp instead of only half of the available color ramp, improving its legibility.

## Discussion

The missing county table will feature all the same information, it will just be more concise.
